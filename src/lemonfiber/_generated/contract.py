left off a list of what this program reaches. What it costs to allow is the shortest
answer on the list: it carries nothing at all, so the only thing switching it off
keeps from anybody is the knowledge that a version came out.

The eighth goes where the operator points it and nowhere else: a plugin's git
source, named at install. It is the only entry whose destination nobody chose in
advance, which is why it is made only when somebody names one.
