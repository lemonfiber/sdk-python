"""The asynchronous client, on aiohttp.

A pinned address is reached with an `aiohttp.Fingerprint` on every request:
aiohttp compares the certificate's SHA-256 digest with it once the handshake
completes and before a byte of the request is written, and refuses the
connection where they differ (`ARCH-R99`). It is given per request rather than
to a connector, so it holds on a session the caller supplied, whatever that
session's connector was built with; an unpinned https address is given a
verifying context per request for the same reason.
