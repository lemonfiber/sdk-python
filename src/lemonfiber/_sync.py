"""The synchronous client, on urllib3.

A pinned address is reached through a connection pool holding the pin as
`assert_fingerprint`: urllib3 compares the certificate's SHA-256 digest with it
once the handshake completes and before a byte of the request is written, and
refuses the connection where they differ (`ARCH-R99`). The pool is built here
from the address alone, so no argument reaches the transport's options.
