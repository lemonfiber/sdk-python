"""Decide whether a change touches code, so the jobs that judge only code can skip one that does not.

A pull request that changes only documentation holds runners for the Python
toolchain, the test suite, mutation testing, the backward-compatibility check,
the coverage run and the CodeQL analysis, and none of them can answer
differently than it did on the base. So each of those jobs asks this first,
through a `what changed` job, and skips where the answer is no. `ci.yml`,
`sonar.yml` and `codeql.yml` each run that job, and all three run this script,
so they cannot disagree about a path.

It answers once per kind of gate, as a line written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`:

  code     the Python gates in `ci.yml` and the coverage run in `sonar.yml`.
           Documentation is not code: `docs/`, any Markdown file and
           `LICENSE`, none of which those gates read. Nor is anything under
           `.github/` but the two workflows that run them, and those two
           neither where every line a change makes to them is a pin on a
           shared workflow from `lemonfiber/spec`, since those jobs run no
           Python.
  analyze  the CodeQL analyses, one of which reads `.github/`. Only
           documentation is not code for them.

Anything not named as documentation is code, so a file of a kind nobody has
thought about runs every gate. A rename is read as the deletion and the addition
it is, so moving a module into `docs/` reaches code through the deletion.

Asked about nothing it can compare (no base, a base that is not the full id of
a commit here, a push that opened a branch) it answers yes for every gate. So
does a run that fails: the jobs asking run whenever the `what changed` job did
not succeed.
