"""Hold a mutation run to the minimum score `pyproject.toml` sets.

Reads what `mutmut export-cicd-stats` wrote. The score is the share of mutants
the suite told apart from the code it was written against: a mutant killed or
timed out counts, and one that survived, that no test reached, or that was
suspicious does not. A run that mutated nothing is a failure rather than a pass,
since a score over no mutants says nothing about the suite.
